            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Before <hi>Lordſhip</hi> and <hi>Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> were added to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb facs="tcp:40222:3"/>Titles, you was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to this book: your dignities being dignified by you, I conſidered not their eminency, but the eminency of your Vertue and Piety. I know, My Lord, that you aim at a better reward than this world can give; but that a great light ſet on a high place cannot be hid from the eyes of Men, Angels alone ſhould rejoyce in the brightneſs of yours: you ſhun praiſe as much as you deſerve it: you neither deſire nor want any thing of Fame. But, My Lord, I wanted a living ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of a ſincere and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout lover of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S to exemplifie my Diſcourſe: and though (God be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
<pb facs="tcp:40222:3"/>many more might be found in this Church, yet you are one of the faireſt and moſt attractive: in ſo much that though it be eaſier to write than to do well, yet a better Pattern of a Religious Life might be drawn from your actions than from my directions.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have juſt cauſe to fear that I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd my genius too far, and perhaps ſome will think that I would have Godlineſs to be <hi>Shorn</hi> and devotion a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe</hi> from the world, which is far from my thoughts or deſires: though I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that at firſt I intended a much different and leſs defective Treatiſe on this ſo

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever at the beſt I could have added nothing to ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as your Lordſhip; the Holy flames of Divine Love that burn in your heart have too much light and fervency to have receiv'd any increaſe from me: and therefore I have not aim'd at any thing higher than only to aſſiſt the weak and fix the inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. But, My Lord; though I can not in the leaſt profit you by this my poor labour, yet its being own'd by you may be very advantageous to me: Your Reverend and much Honoured name will not only credit me, but which

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>'<seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Is probable that they, who theſe many years, have cry'd out <hi>Popery</hi> (till they made way for it to come) upon every thing they lik'd or underſtood not, will ſtart and think that their fears are come upon them, at the ſight of the firſt Title-page: and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly our Lay-Abbots will alſo be frighted at it, as though the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſt <hi>Coenobites</hi> were coming again to lay claim to their old Manſions and fat indowments. For my part I wiſh that theirs may be but pannick terrors: yet
<pb facs="tcp:40222:6"/>withal, I wiſh they might ſo far affect them, as to make the firſt have a greater value for that <hi>Reform'd Religion,</hi> and purer worſhip which then they would certainly loſe; and the laſt pay Tithes <hi>Conſcienciouſly</hi> out of thoſe eſtates, which then they would be forc'd to reſign. And yet I may, and do aſſure them, that if they will Read not only the Title, but the book alſo, it will certainly cure them of their fears, if it works no better change upon them: for its deſign is not to alter the eſtabliſh'd Religion, but to make us more devout and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in the profeſſion thereof; nor yet to inrich any perſons with temporal eſtates, but to make us <hi>gather treaſures in heaven,</hi> and <hi>ſet our affections on things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the age we live in, is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprav'd, is no obſervation of
<pb facs="tcp:40222:6"/>mine, there are almoſt as many that complain of it, as there are that contribute to the increaſing of its wickedneſs: 'tis in every mans mouth that vertue being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grac'd, vice is countenanc'd, and that the numerouſneſs of its vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, makes it now impudent, as well as faſhionable. Therefore it ſhould be no difficult matter, to perſwade thoſe that have any ſenſe of Religion, or longing after its rewards, that they ought not <hi>to conform themſelves to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil world,</hi> but chuſe a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pattern to live by. And the truth is, it matters not much, whether theſe be worſe than the former times; for the way to life hath all along been <hi>ſtreight and narrow,</hi> and found and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd but by <hi>few:</hi> as that to deſtruction <hi>wide</hi> and ſpacious, and yet crouded by the <hi>many.</hi> Good men have always liv'd in a
<pb facs="tcp:40222:7"/>
               <hi>perverſe and crooked genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> So that if it be now, as it hath ever been, thoſe that will enter into life, muſt follow the <hi>narrow</hi> path, though they have but few fellow travellers: and if it be worſe, they muſt walk with the greater care and wari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. However it be, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference muſt needs be very great, betwixt the lives and works of thoſe, whoſe reward and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition will be ſo vaſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent at laſt. And therefore whoever will go to heaven, had need keep at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from that <hi>world which lieth in wickedneſs,</hi> and take a much contrary courſe, to thoſe <hi>many</hi> who go to deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
            <p>But how then? Muſt we retire into <hi>Thebais,</hi> with the Fathers of the deſert? Muſt we confine our ſelves to the
<pb facs="tcp:40222:7"/>ſolitude of a <hi>Monaſtick Cell?</hi> Or ſhall we become Quakers, and profeſs the ſullenneſs of Melancholy Fanaticks? Why, truly in Popiſh Countreys, the Cloiſter hath ingroſs'd the name of Religion, and they that would be, or be thought to be, devout beyond others, do uſually put on a Fryers hood, and imbrace the Rule of ſome <hi>Religious Order:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us Puritaniſm hath u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp'd the Name of <hi>Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and ſome who, in truth or in pretence, abhor looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or are reclaim'd from a vicious life, will too often forſake not the world, but the Church; as it were to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſtrictneſs of a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer vertue, in the Society of a Separated Brother-hood.

<pb facs="tcp:40222:9"/>School of Vertue and Piety, and every man an <hi>Aſcetick</hi> and ſtrict liver: wiſhing heartily with <hi>Eraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> that they, who hitherto, have been call'd <hi>Preciſe</hi> and <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,</hi> by way of appropriation, might juſtly loſe that name, by the more exemplary lives of all other Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>But though it be my wiſh, it is not my hope in the leaſt, to ſee any ſuch thing come to paſs, by means of this little volume. Many much bigger and better have not been able to effect it; they that will not hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, nay, Chriſt the Lord himſelf, will be far enough from being perſwaded by the meaneſt of his ſervants: and the truth is, it may be the matter of our deſires, but muſt never be expected, that a general Reformation of manners ſhould follow that of Doctrine among us. Nevertheleſs our indeavours ought
<pb facs="tcp:40222:10"/>not to be wanting; though our ſanctification be never conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here below, yet we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.1.</note> and ſhould ſtrive <hi>to perfect holineſs in the fear of God:</hi> and ſo, though we know that many will ſo live, as that the end of them ſhall be deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet ought we like S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to try all means, <hi>that by any means we may ſave ſome.</hi> If we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert none of the impenitent, we may benefit ſome better Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: and if our inſtructing our brethren by word or writing, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits none of them, yet it may make us take the better heed, <hi>that after we have preached to others, we our ſelves be not caſt-aways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to this end, my chiefeſt indeavour, is to make a Chriſtian devout, to make him love God with a ſincere love, and then make it appear by a hearty obedience; a
<pb facs="tcp:40222:10"/>devout love is not only the beſt part, but alſo the beſt inſtrument of Religion, as being an irreconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable enemy to ſin, a friend, or rather a nurſe to all vertue: No inticement could have drawn peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>Magdalene</hi> to her former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purities, whilſt ſhe waſhed her deareſt Saviours feet with her tears: and 'tis known by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that when reading, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſight of a dying friend, or any ſuch thing, hath ſoftned a mans heart into a Religious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, temptations would be then ſo far from prevailing, that they durſt not ſo much as appear before him. But when he returns to mind earthly things, and hath his thoughts taken up with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of this life, he finds that his ſpiritual ſtrength decays, by the ſame proportions that his love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes cold, and he grows inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout again.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:40222:11"/>
            <p>Love is the queen, if not the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of paſſions, the great mover and governor of actions and affections: could we keep the fire of Divine Love always burning in our breaſts, it would be the moſt powerful and beſt inſtrument of Holy-living; it would make ſelf-denial and the yoke of Chriſt eaſie, it would make acts of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Religion pleaſant; and it would make us delight in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing God, as much as we natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally do in pleaſing our ſelves. Therefore I have made it my aim and deſign in the following Pages, to ſeize upon the affections, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle in the hearts of Chriſtians the heavenly flames of the love of God. To that end, I have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the more general benefits of God to mankind, and eſpecially that of Redemption, by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt demonſtration of love that ever was given, the death of Jeſus:
<pb facs="tcp:40222:11"/>which if duly conſider'd, would be an irreſiſtible motive to love him; I have ſhewed the power, the pleaſure, and the great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of love; and I have us'd devout meditations and eja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, as it were to tranſport our ſouls to heaven by love, for to adore that God, whom love brought down from thence to ſave us. 'Tis certain that moſt of them that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, periſh for want of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I have heard dying men wonder at themſelves, how they could be ſo ſtupid, as not to mind thoſe things which are of an infinite concern, and ſhould rather take up all our thoughts and our cares, than be neglected or forgot one only moment. <hi>Iſrael doth not underſtand,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.3.</note> 
               <hi>my people doth not conſider.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love may be ſaid to be that fire which God would have always to burn upon his altar, that is,
<note place="margin">Lev. 6.12.</note> in
<pb facs="tcp:40222:12"/>our hearts, which are his temple, where the ſacrifices of good works and the incenſe of devotion ſhould always be offer'd to him: now that ſacred fire muſt have fewel to entertain it; it muſt be nouriſh'd by reading good books, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by frequent and pious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations. Wherefore I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd as much as I could to feed thoſe holy flames, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting things as they are; and I would have every Chriſtian, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and often to conſider, what God is, what he hath done, what he doth, and what he will do for us, if we love him ſincerely: as alſo, what we are, whence we come, whither we go, and how eaſie it is for us to be eternally hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, if we will ſet our affections up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God, who deſerves them ſo infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely. Doubtleſs inconſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is the cauſe why God is not lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! It is not poſſible men could
<pb facs="tcp:40222:12"/>reſiſt the charms of his love, if they would open the eyes of their mind and of their faith to view them!</p>
            <p>But how few are there that do it? How fully is the propheſie ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd,
<note place="margin">Mat. 24.12</note> Iniquity ſhall abound and the love of many ſhall wax cold? To how many Chriſtians might our Bleſſed Saviour ſay, as once to the Jews, <hi>I know you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Joh. 5.42.</note> 
               <hi>that you have not the love of God in you?</hi> How juſtly might now S. <hi>Paul</hi> complain,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.21.</note> 
               <hi>all men ſeek their own, not the things which are Jeſus Chriſts?</hi> And how juſtly might our Bleſſed Lord, the great lover of men, complain in the words of his Apoſtle, <hi>I will glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpend and be ſpent for you;</hi> (or rather, I have gladly ſpent, and been ſpent for you) <hi>though the more abundantly I love you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 12.15.</note> 
               <hi>the leſs I be loved?</hi> Want of love is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſad &amp; general evil among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<pb facs="tcp:40222:13"/>in theſe worſt of times! and I hope ſome will be by me perſwaded, not careleſly to ſay, that they ſhall do as well as others: but, as wiſe men would in peſtilent times, carefully to provide Antidotes, to prevent or cure the infection. But alaſs, how ſhould I perſwade others? <hi>de ingratis etiam ingrati que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runtur: Phyſician cure thy ſelf;</hi> I help to propagate the diſtemper, and therefore am very unfit to preſcribe againſt it. Shall the unthankful teach gratitude? Shall the <hi>Phariſee</hi> perſwade others, when he ſaith and doth not? If it be as one ſaith, <hi>qui non ardet non accendit,</hi> that he that burns not with the Divine Fire of love, cannot inflame others with it; then I may well cry out with him, <hi>vae mihi frigenti;</hi> wo is me unhappy creature, who am ſo far from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I am almoſt quite cold! and
<pb facs="tcp:40222:13"/>indeed, I know and grieve the defects and imperfections of my love, and have writ for my ſelf, more than for any others: and I heartily wiſh, better hearts and pens would treat of this ſubject, and help, that way amongſt others, to reinkindle that almoſt extinct fire of charity and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hearts of men; and in mine own, who would thankfully uſe their aſſiſtance, and heartily pray for a reward to them.</p>
            <p>I have no more to ſay by way of Preface, but that if I have been ſo unhappy as to write any thing contrary to the Doctrine of the Church; I diſown and retract it before hand, and would blot it out with my blood: as for particular perſons, who may find fault with any thing herein, I deſire them to paſs it by. It matters not much, if they like not every paſſage and expreſſion; if they do but follow
<pb facs="tcp:40222:14"/>what they judge to be good, and approve my deſign, and love Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus with all their hearts; it will be enough for their profit and my ſatisfaction.</p>

                        <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:</hi> and let us with him, <hi>fall down and kneel before the Lord our Maker.</hi> You know that by the Laws of God and of all Nations, there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable obligation upon all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to love and honour their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, becauſe they brought them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world: now certainly the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation doubles upon every man, in reſpect to his <hi>Father which is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> for our natural parents were but ſecond cauſes under him, his own power it was that form'd and created us: they ingendred our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bodies only, he is <hi>the Father of Spirits,</hi> he himſelf gave being to our

                     <p>But there is yet more in this; Creation is not a tranſient act; the ſame power that once gave us our being, doth ſtill exert it ſelf in the continuation thereof. When a child is born, he ſubſiſts by himſelf, his parents need not take any care, that he returns not to his priſtine condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but we have the ſame depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God in our preſervation as we had in our creation; ſhould he withdraw his Almighty hand, we ſhould return to our firſt nothing; <hi>in him we live and move, and have our being;</hi> Therefore we are the more bound to ſerve and love him, that he not only made us to be; but gives us, as it were, a new being every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by continuing our life and duration, by that Almighty will, whereby he effected our firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction.</p>

                     <p>Now if we conſider further, not only that God made us, but what he made us, it will yet inforce thoſe bonds of duty, which Creation tied upon us. For it was in our Makers power, either to make us vile and abject as the vileſt of beaſts, or to deny us thoſe faculties and abilities, which are moſt honourable and moſt uſeful to our nature: but he made us Men, the moſt wonderful of his creatures; in us he joyn'd what hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth had moſt excellent, an immortal Spirit, created after his image, with the moſt elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the moſt perfect of material things: Take a view of the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous organs of thy ſenſes, of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious contrivance of thoſe joints and ligaments which unite thy ſeveral members, of thoſe various and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate channels which contain thy blood and ſpirits; in a word of all the parts and paſſions of thy body, which are all made for neceſſity and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; and then admire the great goodneſs, as well as wiſdom of thy creator; and ſay with the Pſalmiſt, that thou art <hi>fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> and that Gods works <hi>are very marvellous.</hi>

                     <p>Preſervation comes next to be conſider'd; a benefit of very large extent, and well deſerving that rank, the Church hath plac'd it in, in making it the ſubject of our daily thankſgiving; for ever ſince man chang'd the impenetrable armour of Original Righteouſneſs, for a thin covering of fig-leaves, he became ſo defenſleſs, and yet expos'd to ſo many ſharp and wounding arrows, that ſhould not Divine Protection in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe

Repreſent to thy ſelf a man in <hi>Job's</hi> condition, having ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his ulcers and poverty all the ſaddeſt calamities that ever afflicted any man upon earth, eſpecially the remorſes and horrors of a guilty and tormented conſcience, crying out of impatience and deſpair with <hi>Cain, my pain is greater than I can bear.</hi> This unhappy creature having for many years born the uneaſie weight of his miſeries, linger'd out a tedious and diſconſolate life, is at laſt ſtruck to the heart with a mortal wound and dies, and ſo paſſeth from temporal to eternal ſorrows; he falls into a lake of fire and brimſtone, a place where there is nothing but woe and darkneſs, weeping and gnaſhing of teeth; where there is no company but of tormented and tormentors; nothing to be ſeen, but what is fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, no voices to be heard but curſes,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:40222:21"/>ſhrieks and lamentations, where there is the abſence of all good and the preſence of all evil; where <hi>men de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to die,</hi> and <hi>death flees away from them.</hi> This is the fulneſs of his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that it ſhall have no end, that he muſt dwell with everlaſting burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; <hi>their fire is not quenched, and their worm dies not.</hi> If weeping but one tear every day, he might expect to be releaſt, after he had wept as much as would make an ocean, it would be ſome comfort! but at the end of ſo many millions of years as would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to weep a Sea, his torments will be as far from ending as the firſt day they began: and if after this manner in proceſs of time, he ſhould ſhed tears enough to make many more ſeas, yet ſtill it might be truly ſaid, <hi>this is but the beginning of ſorrows;</hi> ſtill there is an intolerable Eternity to come; for after as many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of millions of years as tongue can expreſs or heart comprehend; Eternity is nothing leſſened; ſtill it is what is was before, an abyſs of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that can have no end; this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all comfort, this fills his ſoul with a woful deſpair, this is another hell in the midſt of hell, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageth
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:40222:21"/>him, and perpetually tortures his mind, to think that there will be no end of his ſufferings, that he can conceive no hope of being deliver'd: but that he muſt bear to all Eternity, what every moment is intolerable! O dreadful Eternity, who can ſeriouſly think of thee and not tremble! Now if thou doſt ask for what reaſon this wretched creature is thus tormented, know that it is for ſin; becauſe his firſt parents broke the Law of their Creation, and he followed their foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps; they involv'd him firſt in the guilt of a wicked rebellion againſt God, and afterwards by his own acts he made himſelf yet more criminal; by nature he was a <hi>child of wrath,</hi> and then he became ſo, yet more by his own tranſgreſſions; he was <hi>ſold under ſin,</hi> and then he became a willing ſlave to it; his own thoughts, words, and works being evil, and that continually, he forſook God, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor'd him, and profeſt enmity againſt him, and oppos'd his depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved will to Gods Holy Will, and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came obnoxious to the infinite juſtice of God, which therefore juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts this deſerved puniſhment upon him.</p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:40222:22"/>
                     <p>And now, if knowing the reaſon, thou doſt inquire after the perſon, who by being ſo unholy, is become ſo extremely unhappy; I could ſay with the Prophet, <hi>thou art the man,</hi> this is thy patrimony, as thou art a child of <hi>Adam;</hi> this thou art by nature: but the Divine Mercy hath reſcu'd thee from this miſery, and therefore I muſt ſay, <hi>thou wert the man,</hi> this muſt have been thy caſe, had not the Holy <hi>JESUS</hi> work't thy Redemption by means as wonderful, as was his pity and charity.</p>
                     <p>But before I proceed I muſt alſo propound one queſtion. Two men are equally indebted, and equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to pay; the one is patiently for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and at laſt freely acquitted, the other is caſt into the dungeon, and a while after compaſſionately releaſt and ſet at liberty; I demand, is not he that never entred the Priſon, as much bound to love his generous creditor, as he that was deliver'd out of it? yes doubtleſs, or rather more: becauſe his debt is alſo forgiven, and yet he is freed from that trouble and ſorrow, which his fellow debtor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent. Why then, thy gracious Redeemer, by ſaving thee from the horrors and torments of Hell, hath
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:40222:22"/>laid on thee, at leaſt as great obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to love him, as if he had brought thee out of it, after thou hadſt been long detain'd therein. Therefore I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, thou wouldſt bring thy thoughts back again to that unpleaſant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, and conſider thy ſelf as if thou wert ſhut up in that diſmal dungeon, and then expreſs what thou wouldſt give to be releaſt, what thou wouldſt do for him that ſhould bring thee out of that horrible and bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs pit.</p>
                     <p>I know that they that are afflicted with ſharp pains and grievous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, would purchaſe health with all the wealth they have; and I believe no reward would hire a man, to hold his hand in the fire but for one hours time: therefore I doubt not but that, if it were in a mans power, he would give this, and a thouſand more worlds, to be brought out of an ever-burning furnace: and I am perſwaded, that if thou wilt ſuffer thy fanſy to be active in framing the black and dreadful ſcene of helliſh horrors about thee, thou wilt then heartily ſay, were I owner of the whole univerſe, I would joyfully give it, to come out of theſe ever-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:40222:23"/>flames which torment my body, and to be freed from this never dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worm, the remorſes of my guilty conſcience, which torture my ſoul: but becauſe I have nothing, freely would I give my ſelf to him, that ſhould bring me out of this woful place. O I would follow him any where, do any thing that he ſhould command me, imbrace his feet, kiſs the ground they tread on, and give him all the demonſtrations of a ſincere and paſſionate Love! Well, thy petition is granted, before 'twas preſented; the Love and Mercy of <hi>JESUS</hi> hath prevented thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and diſtreſs: New make good thy vows and reſolutions; Love and Serve <hi>JESUS</hi> thy Redeemer, and give thy ſelf up wholly to him. I know that many may be good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, without <hi>being ſnatch't out of the fire,</hi> without theſe terrors and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frightments: but I am ſhewing what our condition had been without a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, what is that gulf of perdition, whence <hi>JESUS</hi> hath ſav'd us, if we will be ſaved by him: and I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion theſe <hi>terrors of the Lord,</hi> as S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them, <hi>to perſwade men;</hi> to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of an active and vehement
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40222:23"/>Love. For 'tis too obſervable, that few men ſeriouſly conſider what <hi>Redemption</hi> means, what it was we were redeemed from, elſe they could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> be ſo indevout, ſo diſobedient, ſo unthankful to their Saviour. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſing, as I do here, that without Chriſt we were already dead and periſh't, makes it the reaſon of that <hi>Conſtraining Love</hi> which enabled him and other Primitive Chriſtians, to ſuffer ſo patiently, and act ſo zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly for <hi>JESUS; the love of Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>conſtraineth us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we thus judge, that if one died for all then were all dead;</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, we were certainly dead, irrecoverably loſt, had not Chriſt died, to purchaſe life and ſalvation for us: therefore we cannot chuſe but love him, and it is no wonder if that love be ſtrong, and if we are govern'd and acted by it. That thou maiſt therefore love affectionately and live devoutly, conſider ſeriouſly that death, the miſery of that condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein thou wert, and ever muſt have been, hadſt thou not a <hi>JESUS.</hi> I might add, that we were delivered from the power and ſlavery, as well as from the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:40222:24"/>of ſin: but this is included in the other, it being impoſſible <hi>to be ſaved from the wrath to come,</hi> without <hi>bringing forth fruits meet for repentance:</hi> and as it is mercy and grace on God's part, ſo on ours, it is matter of duty and earneſt indeavour, and muſt be the reſult and effect of our love, firſt that we offend not, and then that we ſerve diligently, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly him that <hi>redeemed us from our vain converſation, and gave himſelf for us, that we being dead unto ſin, might live unto righteouſneſs.</hi>

The greatneſs of God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable, his excellencies and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are incomprehenſible, he is infinitely good, powerful, wiſe, and holy: Man contrariwiſe, is in himſelf wicked and weak, ignorant, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and miſerable, there is ſo great a diſproportion betwixt God and man,

'Twas never ſeen that a ſhepherd would creep up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all four, and cover himſelf with a ſheep-skin, to call his flock out of danger, and to expoſe himſelf for it: but <hi>the good ſhepherd</hi> did much more!

Though he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:40222:25"/>was infinitely more above man, then men are above beaſts, yet he became <hi>the ſon of man,</hi> that he might become the Saviour of men: 'Twas never ſeen that a Sovereign Prince would ſeek to reduce to loyalty the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his rebellious ſubjects, by mixing blood with them, uniting their families together: but behold the Supreme Monarch of heaven and earth contracts a near affinity with his ungrateful rebels, who are as vile and miſerable, as they are criminal, that he may free them from their guilt, and win them to their duty and their happineſs.

                     <p>His life, all along, was a continuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his great mercy and humility, <hi>he went about doing good,</hi> healing all manner of diſeaſes Corporal and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:40222:25"/>giving excellent inſtructions and great examples of vertue. But what we now conſider, and what ſhould moſt affect us, is, that for our ſakes <hi>he was a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief,</hi> all the time of his abode here below.

That the eternal Son of God would become our Brother, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Man, and would-live in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty and Contempt, was very much: but that afterwards he would die for us, in that manner as he did, is the greateſt wonder that ever the world ſaw.

The Life of <hi>JESUS,</hi> as we have ſeen, was, as it were, a chain of miſeries, every link, every connection, had ſomething grievous and afflictive, <hi>he was a Man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows:</hi> therefore, we no where read that ever he laught or injoy'd the pleaſures and the mirth of this world: but that he ſuffer'd much and wept ſeveral times, is recorded by the Evangeliſts.

Alſo, the vigor of his nature being neither weakned nor ſpent, by age or diſtempers, he
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:40222:32"/>being full of ſtrength and in the flower of his age, was capable to taſte the ſmart and ſharpneſs of his pain, to the very laſt moment of his life: and ſo 'tis written by <hi>S.

Like the bramble in the fable, which having loſt a rich freight of the fineſt ſilks, and now takes hold of the coar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſtuffs, to recover its loſs; ſo have all

We neglect God, and fall in love with thoſe things that have the leaſt impreſs of his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and then, like Idolaters we pay that worſhip to the work, which is due to the maker only.</p>
                     <p>Therefore ought we to take great heed, that we be not taken with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſeeming beauty or goodneſs: but that we examine whether that be the thing which will make us intirely happy, and beyond which we ſhall

For, if it be not, we muſt paſs it by, and ſeek further, and never reſt, nor ſet our hearts on any thing, till we have found that true and perfect good, moſt obvious and eaſie to be found, which being lov'd will be certainly poſſeſt, and being poſſeſt will make us perfectly happy; and that is God alone.

This reſtleſsneſs and activity of love found work enough for the Fathers of the Deſarts; whoſe inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable pains to mortifie their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful appetites; whoſe unwearied di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to ſerve God; whoſe ſwift and violent motion heaven-ward is the object of our wonder, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braids our ſloth and negligence.

                     <p>The laſt property of love I ſhall now mention, is, that love ſweetens bitter things, makes our labours pleaſant, and even our ſufferings de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful. How heavy is that yoke which is impos'd by an ungrateful hand! the Souldier preſt to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice can hardly bear his arms: but he that is inrol'd by love thinks them light and bears them with pleaſure; the ſlave that works in the Mines counts his very life a burthen: the niggard that works much harder likes well his drudgery, becauſe the love of riches is his task-maſter; he that ſerves his maſter out of fear works faintly and with a heavy heart: he that ſerves him out of love, doth it diligently and yet with chearfulneſs; the Chriſtian pilgrim who is driven heaven-ward with fears and terrors, goeth on with much reluctancy, and a ſorrowful heart: he that is <hi>drawn with the cords of love,</hi> follows with joyfulneſs,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:40222:50"/>minds not the ruggedneſs of his way, and even rejoyceth in his weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, becauſe it brings him nearer and nearer to his beloved: he that could ſay, <hi>the love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> could ſay alſo, <hi>we rejoyce in tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> 'Twas the love of <hi>JESUS</hi> made primitive Chriſtians work hard and ſuffer much,

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40222:51"/>that now my heart is his; I will <hi>love him, becauſe he firſt loved me.</hi> Now it repenteth me that ever I rejected his ſute, that ever I was unkind to him; it grieveth me that ever I countenanc'd and prefer'd his rivals, the luſts of ſenſuality, covetouſneſs, and pride, which I renounc'd in my Baptiſm; I will now exclude them wholly; this is the firſt mark <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS</hi> ſhall receive of my ſincere af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him, that I will entertain nor careſs no longer thoſe his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with whom I have had an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy intelligence for too long a time; henceforth, if they come near me, I will indeavour to drive them away; if they come after me, I will flee; if they perſevere in their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, they ſhall get nothing elſe, but ſhame and denials. Away from me then, ye wicked ſpirits, with all your tempting allurements, worldly vanities, deceitful riches, ſenſual pleaſures; I remember that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd you all, when firſt I gave up my name to <hi>JESUS,</hi> when he firſt began to ſhew and ſeal his love to me, and to ingage mine I then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd <hi>the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40222:51"/>with all covetous deſires of the ſame, and the carnal deſires of the fleſh;</hi> I now remember thoſe my ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and grieve that I have not kept them: and therefore will hate you the more; that you made me forget my promiſes, and break my holy vows. Now will I be reveng'd of you, ye proud and ambitious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, luſtful thoughts, greedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of wealth; I will now kill and crucifie you. Henceforth, it ſhall be my honour, that I am a Servant of <hi>JESUS;</hi> it ſhall be my delight and pleaſure, that I am a lover of <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS;</hi> and it ſhall be my wealth, that he is mine as I am his. <hi>JESUS</hi> hath done and ſuffered much to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his love and to deſerve mine; he hath come down from heaven, and humbled himſelf to my mean and low condition; he hath liv'd poor and deſpiſed; he hath been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and perſecuted; he hath died for me; <hi>hereby I know that he loves me, becauſe he laid down his life for me,</hi> but ye his unworthy rivals never gave me any aſſurance of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, never did, or ſuffered any thing for me. <hi>JESUS</hi> expos'd himſelf to ſhame, that I might become
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40222:52"/>glorious; indur'd pains, that I might have pleaſures; he became poor, that I might be enrich'd: but cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs offers me riches, to pierce me through with many ſorrows; luſt inticeth me, to wound me, when I have conſented to it; and pride promiſeth me honors, to cumber me and expoſe me to envy. <hi>JESUS</hi> is infinitely lovely, he is all perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and goodneſs; and he deſires to be loved, not for any advantage of his own, but to make his lovers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and eternally happy: but you painted idols of abuſed mortals, are in your ſelves ugly, and even loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome; though at a great diſtance, ye may ſeem ſomewhat fair, yet near at hand, ye are nothing but defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; ye always prove vain and vexatious; ye ſeek to enter mens hearts, only to tyrannize and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment them, and betray them to eternal ſorrows. <hi>JESUS</hi> is a true and conſtant lover, he ever owns his friends: he never fails them that love him; he helps them in their diſtreſſes; he comforts them in their ſorrows; and when they die he ſtands by them: but ye temporal deceitful pleaſures, are falſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40222:52"/>ye forſake your friends in their greateſt need; ye flatter them for a few Summer days, while the Sun ſhines kindly upon them; but in the rigors of Winter, when an unproſperous ſtorm ariſeth, you are gone, ye leave them to die com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortleſs; they carry nothing of you, when they go from hence, but the bitter remembrance of your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſneſs. <hi>JESUS</hi> is a moſt grateful lover, he ever returns love for love; he is ever found of them that ſeek him; to them that deſire him he ever gives himſelf; every true lover of <hi>JESUS</hi> is ſure to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him: but you worldly injoyments are generally moſt unkind to your moſt paſſionate lovers; ye flee from them that run after you; ye grieve and vex your greateſt admirers, ye are ever uncertain, falſe and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. I will therefore never love you again; nay, I reſolve to hate and perſecute you; to mortifie the luſts of my fleſh; to humble the pride of my heart, and overcome the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous deſires of my mind: but <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS</hi> ſhall reign in my heart; him will I love; him will I ſerve; him will I indeavour to pleaſe in all

                     <p>Now, To effect this, means are to be us'd; for our hearts will not of a ſudden be brought to a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous temper; 'tis not bare reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will make us reſiſt temptations when they aſſault us, with their moſt prevailing inticements, grace indeed is never wanting to us: but if we be wanting to our ſelves, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in vain: if we ſecond it not with our indeavours, we make it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.

                     <p>Perhaps it will be ſaid, that ſuch things are the effect of melancholy or a forward and miſguided zeal, not of true piety. But let it be conſider'd, that natural love it ſelf hath done, and ſtill doth wonderful things. The love of friendſhip, the love of luſt, the love of riches and ambition have ſet men upon difficult attempts, have made them deſpiſe great dangers, have carried them through many labours and ſufferings, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as great as the moſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Chriſtian ever undertook for <hi>JESUS,</hi> and Eternity. This hath been and is ſtill the effect of Natural Love, and ſure Divine Love, whoſe object is ſo infinitely
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:40222:63"/>more excellent, may do at leaſt as much.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, things temporal ſeem great at a diſtance; but near at hand, they appear, as they are indeed, mean and contemptible: whereas contrariwiſe, things eternal, as they ſeem ſmall and deſpicable afar off, ſo near at hand they appear great and immenſe, they overwhelm the mind. Hence it is, that dying men who are on the brink of eternity, are amaz'd at the thoughts and near pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of it, and expreſs great regret for their paſt inconſideration, and promiſe great things for the future, if they might live longer: looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, as an empty nothing, not to be regarded where eternity appears; and hence it is alſo, that they who approach things eternal, and view them by meditation and contemplation, are of the ſame mind, have the ſame apprehenſions of them, and act accordingly: doing thoſe things which dying men repent they have not doue; for indeed, it is no illuſion or deceit, but a great and real truth, that the world and all it's concerns are nothing, compar'd to eternity: and that we can never
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:40222:64"/>be too careful to obtain eternal joys, and avoid eternal ſorrows. How much the Bleſſed Apoſtles and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians were acted by this conſideration,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, &amp;c.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſaying, that whilſt they look't not on things viſible and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory, but on things inviſible and eternal, then their afflictions were <hi>light and but for a moment;</hi> though, they laſted many years, and were ſo great, that the very thoughts of them can make us tremble, yet they were light &amp; momentary, whilſt they look'd on eternity: and <hi>they fainted not, though their outward man decay'd daily,</hi> by their great mortifications, and their laborious zeal to ſerve God: and all this, <hi>whilſt we look not on the things that are ſeen, but on the things which are not ſeen: for the things which are ſeen are temporal, but the things which are not ſeen are eternal;</hi> So that it is the effect of a wiſe and moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conſideration, to value and love him above all things, who by dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for us; hath reſcu'd us from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruine, and obtain'd eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs for us: and to make it appear by all means poſſible, doing or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering any thing that may manifeſt

                     <p>But the beſt half of repentance is yet behind; that which is moſt to be attended to, that which I muſt chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſign in all acts of mortification is, that I return no more to thoſe ſins for the which I grieve and afflict my ſelf. The occaſions and inticements of ſin will doubtleſs come again; my thoughts will not always be fix'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:40222:66"/>on Divine Objects, my mind will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the world; my paſſions will be diſorderly and my appetite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly again: how ſhall I ſtand, and reſiſt, and be ſafe, in the time of danger, in the hour of tryal and temptation? I reſolve to lift up my ſoul to <hi>JESUS</hi> and beg his aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; I will remember my vows and ingagements, how much I am bound to love and obey <hi>JESUS</hi> rather than my luſts, and how much a gainer I ſhall be by it.</p>
                     <p>Thus, when a provocation to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is given, and I find my heart riſe, and my ſpirits take fire and grow turbulent, inſtead of giving way to paſſion, or ſuffering that it ſhould proceed to hatred and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, I will turn aſide and check my ſelf with the remembrance of my meekeſt Saviour,

This caus'd great troubles to <hi>Irenea,</hi> who lik'd it well as ſhe lov'd her ſiſter, but could not but grieve at it, as ſhe lov'd the Prince (for unhappily ſhe had ſettl'd her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on him.)

Chriſtian, if thou doſt underſtand the greatneſs of my love which brought me here to die for thee; if thou art ſenſible of it, and wouldſt make any return for it, do this, obey this command; this may be the laſt thing thou ſhalt ever do for me, this may be the laſt tryal of thy love: ſure it would grieve thee to have denied this ſmall requeſt to him that gives his life, that gives himſelf for thee.

                     <p>Thus much of neceſſity muſt be done; my duty as well as my love conſtrains me to it. Not to break negative precepts and to obey poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ones, (that is, to ceaſe from ſin and to work righteouſneſs,) is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:40222:94"/>of me; if I do it by love, I have made my task pleaſant: but yet a task it is, which muſt be fulfill'd. Not but that there is mercy for ſins againſt the New-covenant, for the tranſgreſſion of Goſpel precepts; there is joy in heaven at the converſion of a ſinner, what ever his ſins have been; and it ought greatly to indear God to us, that he is ſo willing to forgive; ſo deſirous to have us repent, that we may be capable of his pardon: but whether ſoon or late, whether after crying guilts or ordinary ſins, ſtill I ſay, there muſt be a true contrition, a ſorrow and repentance for our ſins, proceeding from the love of God, and a ſincere indeavour to pleaſe and obey him for the future; and ſo, thus far we are drawn by a moral neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, by the deſire of our own happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which is not to be obtain'd any other way. But ſhall we ſtay juſt here, and not go one ſtep further than is required? 'tis well indeed when we are ſafe, and that muſt be ſecur'd firſt of all, and with the greateſt care; but ſhall our love proceed no further? Sure that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian who is beſt aſſur'd of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will love God moſt of all and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:40222:95"/>make to him the greateſt and moſt hearty returns. When a man is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for heaven and enjoys the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt happineſs this world is capable of; that is, a ſenſe of Gods favour and a well-grounded aſſurance of a future bliſs, his ſoul cannot but melt into the moſt affectionate love for that gracious God, whoſe mercy and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs hath brought him into that happy condition and fitted him by his grace for a much happier; and they, I ſay, that are in ſuch a caſe (for to them only I now ſpeak) may well do ſomething more, than what needs they muſt; may well en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their affections to God, beyond the bounds of preſcribed duties, it is a good ſign, a ſign of a ſincere and a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart, when a man is forward to undertake for God: when he doth not weigh grains and ſcruples, leſt he ſhould part with any of his right and liberty: but affords God a full meaſure and running over, and think he never gives enough, and ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires that he might do infinitely more for him. 'Tis true that properly ſpeaking, all is due to God: and the more any, the beſt Chriſtian returns, the more he hath receiv'd, and ſo the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:40222:95"/>more he is indebted; but yet, God is pleas'd not to require all that he gives, nor all that we may give, that we may have wherewith to make a free-will-offering; that we may have ſomething to give him, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires not, tokens of our greater love and gratitude.

                        <hi>What ſhall I render unto the Lord for all the benefits that he hath done unto me?</hi> Though the benefits which God vouchſafed his people then, were much inferior to thoſe he hath ſince beſtowed upon us; (<hi>for eye had not</hi> then <hi>ſeen nor ear heard, neither was it entred into the heart of man,</hi> what great things God would do for them that love him, as he hath now declar'd in the revelations of his Goſpel,) though he had tied them to a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome and moſt expenſive ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: yet he accepted their volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary vows and ingagements, and was well pleas'd with them: yet he would receive their free-will-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and delight in them. And
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:40222:96"/>ſure we are more oblig'd than the Jews to let our love and gratitude break forth beyond the limits of commands and expreſs injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and now that God hath open'd to us his rareſt treaſures, his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, for to give us his beloved Son, he will not reject our free oblations, the voluntary acknowledgments of his undeſerved and unſpeakable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. 'Tis not to be denied (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving the lie to the learning and piety of the beſt Chriſtians in all ages) but that there is in the New Teſtament counſels as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, ſome things recommended, though not commanded; he that ſells all that he hath for to buy <hi>the pearl of great price,</hi> and they that make themſelves <hi>Eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven,</hi>

And as it is the beſt indication of a devout and loving ſoul, cheerfully to exceed what is ſtrictly required: it is alſo the beſt fence to immure and ſecure our duty; for then, when we
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:40222:96"/>ſlack and abate, we may be ſtill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our due bounds; nay more, I am confdent that as it is beſt and ſafeſt, it is alſo eaſier, to give free-will-offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, than only, juſt to pay the daily commanded ſacrifice, becauſe thoſe proceed from affection, theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps only from injunction. He that is deſired to go one mile and goes two or ten, finds his way pleaſant, for love leads him: but he that is preſt to the ſame journey, and is acted by fear and compulſion, while he reſolves not to go one foot farther than needs he muſt, will eaſily be tempted to ſtay one ſhort of what he ſhould. But this is better underſtood by the devout lovers of <hi>JESUS</hi> than I can expreſs it.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:40222:98"/>if not Apoſtolick conſtitution; hence the deſuetude of faſting upon appointed days, and even of bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of them: and the non-obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of Holy-days, and times of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn devotion; hence the ſlight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard had to the publick worſhip of God, and the ſeldom receiving of the Lords Supper; hence the reſervedneſs &amp; unhappy ſecreſie of moſt people in not acquainting their ſpiritual guides with the ſtate of their conſcience when it needs, and not receiving their comforts and directions; hence the not ſending for the elders of the Church to do their office upon ſick perſons, and the ſeldom deſiring their abſolution; and hence even in too many of the Clergy, the neglect of daily ſaying Divine Offices, as they are commanded, and obſerving other injunctions peculiar to them. I may ſay that it fares with our Church as with ſome Princes, who have their due Sovereignty denied them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Chriſtians: (as if by becoming members and defenders of the Church, they were become ſubject to Pontifical Chairs and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan Synods) for ſo, many would not have this Church obey'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

We ſhall make it appear that we own the Authority of our heavenly King, when we are ſubject to thoſe his officers, by whom he now reigns over us: to whom he hath given the keys of his kingdom, and whom he hath appointed Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of his ſaving Myſteries: we ſhall have a ſhare in the Myſterious repreſentation of the great expiatory

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:40222:100"/>ſomething of them already: and the chiefeſt uſe and deſign of them is to mortifie ſenſual luſts, and to keep under the body that the ſpirit may rule and be obey'd; yet, as they are exerciſes of repentance, marks of the juſt indignation we conceive againſt our ſelves for having diſpleas'd God; as they may effect or expreſs a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reliſh of temporal pleaſures, a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for heavenly joys, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to take up our croſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>JESUS;</hi> they may be the matter of a free-will-offering, and they may find a gracious reward and acceptance in ſo much as they proceed from a ſincere love to <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS.</hi> Prayer alſo, thankſgiving, reading, meditation, acts of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; though, as to the ſubſtance, they be the diſcharge of the greateſt duty God requires of us, the worſhip and adoration of his Divine Majeſty: yet as to the quantity, they may become free oblations, the expreſſions of a greater love. He that with devout affections inlargeth his offices, or counts the frequency of them by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical hours and wiſh't for oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities: and he that ſets apart large portions for religious exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:40222:100"/>or in the following of his neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary buſineſs, doth often lift up his heart and thoughts to heaven and heavenly things, makes a voluntary offering of ſome of his time, to him of whoſe eternity he hopes to be partaker. He that defalks ſome hours from the refreſhment of his body, to beſtow them upon his ſoul; he that chuſeth a meaner condition and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, that having fewer avoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he may ſpend more time upon Religion; and he that bears with ſome wrongs and injuries, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing free from the diſtractions of quarrels and law-ſuits, he may be the better diſpos'd to ſerve God, hath bought the bleſſed opportunity of attending <hi>JESUS</hi> and indearing himſelf to him. Charity likewiſe, whether Spiritual or Corporal, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in giving or in forgiving may be carried further than is abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and ſo become a free obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He that takes great pains to inſtruct the ignorant, to convert ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by all means to win ſouls to <hi>JESUS,</hi> may manifeſt a greater love than was abſolutely neceſſary to his own ſalvation; and he that makes it his buſineſs and delight to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:40222:101"/>quarrels or make reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; to comfort and defend the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and oppreſſed, to viſit ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpitals and relieve the poor; and to ſpend all his ſubſtance in pious uſes, for the honour of God, and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and for the preſent and future happineſs of men, may exceed what God would have rewarded, and by ſhewing ſo great a love inrich his crown of glory and recompence. I only mark the head-ſprings or ſtore-houſes of thoſe arbitrary gifts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with men may honour God and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich themſelves: the ſeveral ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations and offerings which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from them, being free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable, cannot be ſpecified, and ſhould not be impos'd.

                     <p>The firſt is, that it is moſt unjuſt and unreaſonable to love any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the prejudice of the Creator. As all things have their being from God, ſo they have from him all the goodneſs and beauty which makes them lovely to us: and God drawing upon viſible objects fair copies of his inviſible perfections, deſign'd to be lov'd in them: or that they ſhould be lov'd in him, and for his ſake. <hi>If men being delighted with the beauty of the heavenly hoſt took them to be gods,</hi>

                        <hi>let them know how much better the Lord of them is, for the firſt Author of beauty hath created them:
<note place="margin">5.</note> for by the beauty and greatneſs of the creatures proportionably the maker of them is ſeen.</hi> Beauty and goodneſs are the proper object of love: and therefore, God who is the firſt and ſupreme beauty and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould be loved before all things. We indeed reverence Princes in their ſeals and arms, in their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſervants cloth'd with their livery:
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:40222:104"/>but ſhould a ſubject ſet up theſe in the royal throne, and transfer to them, or even to the greateſt Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite, thoſe ſpecial honours which belong to the Prince only: he ſhould juſtly be deem'd a Rebel, and his proceedings would be as unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as the diſloyal diſtinction of <hi>taking arms by the Kings Authority againſt his Perſon.</hi> Yet ſuch are the proceedings of all diſorderly lovers, I mean of all ſinners: who ſetting more of their affections upon the creatures, than upon God the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, pay them afterwards a greater veneration than they do to him; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving exalted honours, pleaſures, and riches into the Imperial chair, they do more for them than for the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign himſelf: nay they obey them to his prejudice, and againſt his expreſs command. Thus vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unreaſonable men burn in the ſhade, and freeze where the Sun ſhines; they dote upon inferior beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and neglect the higheſt and moſt perfect; they take fire at dark ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and find no heat in the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt light. Great men have a reſpect paid them, in their degenerating poſterity: great Artiſts are reſpected
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:40222:104"/>in their liveleſs children; we highly honour unhappy Pagans in thoſe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors of theirs which adorn our clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets and libraries: God only is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour'd in his works, the more perfect he hath made them, the more injurious they prove to him. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias</hi> and <hi>Apelles</hi> are remembred with veneration, in a fine picture or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: God only is ingratefully forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in a lovely creature whereof he is Maker. An abſurd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety this is,
<note place="margin">Abſurdum est genu po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſito ſimulacra adorare, &amp; ſuſpicere, fabros vero qui ea fecerunt contemnere.</note> which <hi>Seneca</hi> reprov'd in his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heathen, to worſhip and deifie the carved image, and to take no notice of the Carver that made it. God hath done like a loving father, who jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of his ſons affection, would have none to tend him but ſuch as wear his livery; would have the picture of himſelf hang in every room; and all the goods in the houſe markt with his name and cypher: So God, who loves men tenderly, and deſires to be by them lov'd again, hath put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of himſelf in all the creatures he hath appointed to ſerve us; that, which way ſoever we turn our eyes, we might be put in mind of him, he
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:40222:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>hath ſtampt his name, in more or leſs legible Characters, upon all the goods and utenſils of this his great houſe, the world, wherein he hath plac'd us. And now ſhall we do like a ſimple child, who turning his back upon his father, ſhould look and ſmile on his picture, and careſs it, and wait upon it, and ask it bleſſing, while he ſlights the original? So ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd a thing would be counted mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and move pity or laughter: but when we act the ſame folly, in loving the world whilſt we deſpiſe God, we are highly criminal, &amp; we highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke our heavenly Father, thus to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him contempt &amp; diſobedience for the gracious tokens of his love. From hence it follows, that as we ſhould love God above all and all things, things in him and for him: we ſhould alſo love thoſe things moſt, which have moſt of his impreſs and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Therefore, man who is created after Gods image, ſhould be by us lov'd above all other creatures: and that part of man which is chiefly adorn'd with the likeneſs of God, ſhould have the greater ſhare of our affection. God himſelf values hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſouls at a high rate, becauſe
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:40222:105"/>they are like him; as appears by what he hath done and ſuffered to ſave them. And for the ſame reaſon alſo, we ſhould pay to the ſouls of men the beſt part of that kindneſs we owe them: and if we do not, we give our friends no greater love than children to their puppets; for they dreſs them fine, and lay them ſoft, and kiſs and imbrace them: Juſt as they who aim at nothing more than to make their friends merry, to wiſh them toys and gaudy things and to ſee them at eaſe. A fondneſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable in rational creatures, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Chriſtians, who know the worth of an immortal ſoul and the great concern of Eternity: and yet ſeek only to gratifie the material part of their friends which is ſubject to corruption, and to ingage their affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the world which paſſeth away and they muſt ſoon leave. As if when King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt was haſtning out of the Holy-land hither to receive the Crown which expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, his friends had ſtaid him by the way, and invited him to reſt and caſe, and provided for him all Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly delights, and entertainments, and retarded his coming ſo long, till he
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:40222:106"/>had forgot or loſt his right and his kingdom. <hi>What is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world and loſe his ſoul? and what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul?</hi> We are indeed much commanded <hi>to love one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and in this conſiſteth one great half of our Religion, all juſtice and charity, and all the duties of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table.

                     <p>A ſecond conſideration may be, that it is moſt juſt and eaſie to love God. That it is moſt juſt, is ſhown all along this diſcourſe, wherein I have repreſented the more general and moſt excellent benefits of God to mankind: all the which challenge and deſerve the greateſt love our hearts are capable of. God had requir'd of his people that the firſt-born and the firſt fruits ſhould be conſecrated to him, thereby to acknowledge him
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:40222:107"/>the author of all their bleſſings and the giver of all their increaſe: Now the firſt-born of our ſouls, the firſt-fruits of our hearts is love, which God, who gives us all things, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands as an acknowledgment from us. <hi>thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy ſoul.</hi> We therefore commit a greater ſacriledge if we deny him ſo juſt a tribute, than if a Jew had rob'd him of his firſt grapes or his firſt ears of corn. But it is ſo much the more juſt, in that it is moſt eaſie to love God. Infinite perfections, an abyſs of goodneſs whence rivers and oceans of good things do perpetually flow, one would think ſhould ſwallow up the hearts and affections of men: as indeed it doth, of all that duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it. And more perfectly of bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Saints, and of thoſe bleſſed ſpirits who miniſter before his throne and are all flame for him. Beſides, 'tis natural for men to love what is theirs, propriety begets or increaſeth love: Now God is our God; he hath given himſelf for us, he doth now, and will more intirely hereafter give himſelf to us; he made us for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of himſelf, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:40222:107"/>he hath redeem'd us: and that we might all ſay, with <hi>David, O God thou art my God,</hi> that God might ſhew his kindneſs and indear himſelf to us, and aſſert our right to him, he hath aſſum'd the names of thoſe relations who love us beſt, whom we love moſt tenderly, and whom we count moſt ours. God the Father is pleas'd to be call'd our Father, God the Son, our Brother, and God the Holy Ghoſt our Comforter, as it were our friend: thereby to expreſs that affection which he hath for us, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety which we may claim in him. Sure 'tis an eaſie thing to love them that love us:

                     <p>Now here I will digreſs a little to anſwer two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which poſſibly might be made againſt what I have ſaid of Divine Love. The firſt, that I have humaniz'd it too much; that whereas it is ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural and ſhould be ſpiritual, I have made it almoſt palpable and ſenſible. To this I ſay, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſet our love upon earthly or heavenly things, upon God or upon the world, ſtill it is the ſame paſſion, which reſides in the ſame humane faculty. The will of man, and the effects thereof are alike evident and real. He that truly loves God, hath that ſame hearty affection for him,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:40222:109"/>as to the kind, as one friend hath for another: a ſincere lover of <hi>JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS</hi> will ſeek to pleaſe him, and to be with him, and to enjoy him, and do all that for him, which men would do for thoſe whom they love heartily: all the difference is, that Divine Love hath its proper expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, can never be too great, and is in all reſpects infinitely more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the love of any creature. Therefore, if in ſome places I have repreſented things plainly, and made that, in ſome manner to be touch't by ſenſe which is only the object of faith, my deſign was thereby to move the affections, and to bring down the notions of Religion, from the head into the heart.

                     <p>A third conſideration will be that it is moſt pleaſant and ſafe to love God. Love may cauſe trouble, but it certainly is the ſpring or parent of all joy and ſatisfaction. He that hath an affection to nothing hath pleaſure in nothing: could the imaginary apathy of the Stoicks really ſeize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any man: if he could never be miſerable, he would alſo be uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all happineſs. 'Tis true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that the love of worldly things, in that they are vain and periſhing, is it ſelf vanity and vexation: <hi>qui multum amat plus dolet,</hi> is certainly true of all but the Divine Love. He that hath many friends hath many ſorrows; he that loves many things hath many things to fear for: 'Tis only God that hath thoſe infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies which can fully repleniſh our minds and deſires: 'Tis only God that admits of <hi>no variableneſs neither ſhadow of turning:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis the love of God alone that can make us eternally and intirely happy. It is reported of a perſon of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:40222:113"/>great ſanctity, that an evil ſpirit con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to him, that were it poſſible for one who loves God to come into hell; yet it were impoſſible he ſhould be miſerable but that it would rather ſink hell it ſelf and make it diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, or elſe make it a paradiſe for him. Though the relation may be fabulous, yet I believe the thing it ſelf is true: However, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the love of God would ſweeten all the bitterneſs of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent miſeries, and that it is only the imperfection of a Chriſtians love that expoſeth his mind to the vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of humane ſorrows. I am not (to my grief) a competent witneſs to this truth: but there have been many Saints and devout perſons who, in the fervency of their love to God, have found thoſe joys,
<note place="margin">Nihil crus ſentit in nervo, dum animus eſt in Coelo.</note> thoſe raviſhments of joy which are ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which made them, in ſome manner inſenſible and incapable of any great ſorrow. And even the leſſer love of more imperfect, though ſincere, Chriſtians, doth in a great meaſure take away the ſenſe of humane cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and brings to their minds
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:40222:114"/>the greateſt contentment and delight this world is capable of.

                     <p>The fourth and laſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration is, that the love of God is the ſolid joy and laſting Tranquillity of the Soul. No tormenting fear or ſadneſs can harbour in a heart that loves God; the Motto of love might well be that of a late order of Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood at <hi>Mantua,</hi> mean't of the Holy Chalice, <hi>Nihil iſto triſte recepto;</hi> grief and the love of God are incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible: no ſadneſs ſhould enter that breaſt wherein dwells Divine Love. I need not treat at large of thoſe many doubts and terrors concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing future happineſs which grieve and almoſt diſtract the hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſtians to prove that it is a happy thing to be freed from them: there are few, but are ſo far ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them as readily to aſſent to it; it will be more to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſhew that the love of God is
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:40222:118"/>the beſt remedy againſt them, the beſt balſom to heal <hi>a wounded ſpirit.</hi> Some perſons from their poverty, bodily pains, or other afflictions draw this moſt afflictive inference, that God is not their friend, and that therefore their condition is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and very bad, if not quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate: and this adds ſuch a weight to their croſs, that they have no ſtrength to bear it, but are ready to ſink; whereas the love of God hath enabled thouſands to bear a heavier with patience, with fortitude, and men with cheerfulneſs; <hi>I take plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in infirmities, and diſtreſſes, and neceſſities for Chriſts ſake,</hi> ſaid S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that great lover of <hi>JESUS.</hi> He that would ſuffer for God, will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from God: he that would die and be crucified, for <hi>JESUS,</hi> will willingly bear that croſs which <hi>JESUS</hi> lays upon his ſhoulders. And indeed 'tis a greater vertue, meekly, and thankfully to accept of that correction wherewith God vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits us, than voluntarily to inflict the greateſt ſufferings on our ſelves: what proceeds from God is ever beſt for us, and moſt pleaſing to him. No <hi>Patient</hi> will queſtion the love of
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:40222:118"/>that <hi>Phyſician</hi> who is his intimate friend, for that he makes inciſions, and applies cauſticks upon him, and makes him drink bitter potions; he will not ſuſpect his friends affection; he will not doubt but that 'tis for his good: after this manner, he that loves God will receive afflictions from him, and gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with <hi>David, I know that of very faithfulneſs thou haſt caus'd me to be troubled.</hi> Knowing that <hi>all things work together for the good of them that love God,</hi> he will harbour no thoughts of diffidence, nor queſtion Gods lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving kindneſs to him: but reſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that while he loves God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can hurt him, and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever happens is certainly for his greateſt advantage.</p>
                     <p>But 'tis not always the ſtorms of adverſity that bring thoſe dark and diſmal clouds on the minds of men: they come ſometimes in fair wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in the greateſt proſperity. Whence, 'tis in vain to examine: better it is to drive them away, for they are as miſchievous as black. They caſt a damp upon mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; they freeze their hearts in ſuch
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:40222:119"/>a manner that they can receive no ſpiritual joy; they ſo weaken their hands and feet, that they can hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly work for God, or walk in his ways: ſo that their condition is ſad indeed, not becauſe God is their enemy: but becauſe they being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably afraid of it, are thereby hindred from being his friends. To this evil none can preſcribe a better remedy than love: let ſuch perſons love God heartily, and all theſe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors will vaniſh away like the vain images of a terrible dream; when one awaketh. Love begets love, therefore we ſhould love God <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he firſt loved us:</hi> and love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a confidence of being lov'd again: ſo that if we love God we ſhall not long doubt but that we are lov'd by him: and then all is well. And if at firſt, our hearts do not melt into devout affections, and are not repleniſh'd with the ſweetneſs and comfort of love, let us not be diſmay'd at it, nor too much ſtudy our own diſturbed thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions: but let us continue to give God demonſtrations of love, to abſtein from what he forbids, and to do that which he commands, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:40222:119"/>that which will pleaſe him, though uncommanded: and then either ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly joys and extaſies will come, or it will be as well without them. No man is afraid of his friends, nor of thoſe whom he ſerves and obligeth; we eaſily ſuppoſe that they love us, whom we love, and that they to whom we do good will be kind to us: therefore let us ſhew to God all the love we can, and by words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proteſt that we ſeek to pleaſe him, and our hearts will ſoon be poſſeſt with a bleſſed aſſurance that we are dear to him, and he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be cruel and ſevere to us.
